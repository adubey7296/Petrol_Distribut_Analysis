Q.1) In real life what is the total amount of petrol in volume sold by every distributor?

	SELECT distributer_name,SUM(vol_OUT) FROM petrol GROUP BY distributer_name;

Q.2) Which are the top 10 distributors ID's for selling petrol & also display the amount of petrol sold
     in volume by them individually?

	SELECT distributor_id,vol_OUT FROM petrol order by vol_OUT desc limit 10;

Q.3) Find real life 10 distributor name who sold petrol in the least amount.

	SELECT distributor_id,vol_OUT FROM petrol order by vol_OUT limit 10;

Q.4) List all distributors who have this difference, along with the year and the difference which they have in that year.
	(((((The constraint to this query is the difference between volumeIN and volumeOuT is illegal in real life if 
    	 greater than 500. As we see all distributors are receiving patrols on every next cycle.)))))
	
	SELECT Name_Distributer,(vol_IN-vol_OUT) as Difference,year FROM petrol GROUP BY Name_Distributer,
		Difference,year having (vol_IN - vol_OUT) > 500;
